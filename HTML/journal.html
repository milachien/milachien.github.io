Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
through some interesting places on the way:
</p>
<ul> 
 	<li> Walla Walla, WA</li> 
 	<li>Magic City, ID</li> 
 	<li>Bountiful, UT</li> 
 	<li>Last Chance, CO</li> 
 	<li>Truth or Consequences, NM
 	<li>Why, AZ</li> 
 </ul>

I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
<blockquote>
<b> 
<br>"Passing cars, 
<br>When you can't see,
<br>May get you, 
<br>A glimpse, 
<br>Of eternity."
</b>
</blockquote>
I definitely won't be passing any cars.
</p>

<h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
<p>
My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
<ul> 
	<li>cellphone</li> 
	<li>iPod</li>
	<li>digital camera</li>
	<li> a protein bar</li>
Just the essentials.  
</ul>
<br>
<br>
As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
